What do i want to do with programming in the future?

I would like to become so good at programming that it isn't a torment or an obligation to do it in a job, but to do it for pleasure and try to investigate even more of what I know to link it with biomedical engineering, for example work in large companies where biomedical equipment is manufactured and be in charge of that part, program the equipment for its operation, work on large projects to create new technologies that can help many people with disabilities, so that every time the technology and its advances make it easier forthem to lead their lifestyle.
I hope to be a great programmer in the future and learn more every day, because technology is something that is constantly updated and I believe that every day you learn making it something less monotonous and much interesting and exciting.

Note: Sorry for my bad punctuation and my bad English. I will improve it.
